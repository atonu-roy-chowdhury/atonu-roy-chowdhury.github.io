# About Me
Hello there! This is Atonu Roy Chowdhury. I'm currently studying Pure Mathematics at BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. 


I love to learn. Apart from Mathematics my topics of interest are: Biology (specially Neuroscience and Psychology), Physics, Philosophy, Music, Art. Recently I've started growing interest in filmmaking. 


Sometimes I write some articles on Medium. They can be found [here](https://atonu-roy-chowdhury.medium.com). I also plan to add them to [this site](/writings). 

I am a trainer at Bangladesh Mathematical Olympiad camps. The resources I made for Olympiad Math training can be found [here](/olymath).
